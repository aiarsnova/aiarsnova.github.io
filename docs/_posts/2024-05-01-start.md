In May 2024, we embarked on a journey to break the boundaries between music and artificial intelligence, exploring new possibilities and creating innovative experiences. AI Ars Nova was founded by a collective of classical musicians and AI researchers with the shared vision of blending traditional musical artistry with cutting-edge technology.

Our mission is to redefine the future of music, where art and AI coexist harmoniously, pushing the limits of creativity and expression. As we move forward, we are excited to explore the uncharted territories of this new era, where technology enhances the beauty and depth of human creativity. Welcome to the beginning of a transformative journey with AI Ars Nova.
